# Discovery Prep

**⚠️ DATA RULE:** The worst thing that can happen in a meeting is being surprised.
Pull everything. Find the latest news. Miss nothing.

**⚠️ DATE RULE:** Check `currentDate`. Output file named `YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-brief.md`.
Don't use training knowledge for "latest news" — always pull live data.

---

## STEP 0 — Confirm Meeting Details

Ask if not provided:
1. Account name + type of meeting (intro / discovery / follow-up / AE-led)
2. Date and time
3. Who's on the call (their side + your side)
4. How did this meeting get booked? What's the context?

---

## STEP 1 — Internal Knowledge Refresh

Check all existing intel before going to the web:



**Local files:**
- `accounts/{account}/account-brief.md` → full qualification status
- `accounts/{account}/research/` → most recent research file
- `accounts/{account}/discovery/` → all prior call notes
- `accounts/{account}/meetings/` → prior meeting briefs

**Build picture before Step 2:**
- What do we know vs. what are we guessing?
- Which {{QUALIFICATION_FRAMEWORK}} elements are confirmed vs. blank?
- What was the goal of the last interaction?

---

## STEP 2 — Fresh External Intel (Last 30 Days)

Search for anything published recently about the company or attendees:

**Full mode (Bright Data):**
```
mcp__brightdata__search_engine:
1. "{Company} news 2026"
2. "{Company} funding announcement 2026"
3. "{Attendee names} LinkedIn blog post conference 2026"
4. "{Company} product launch 2026"
5. "{{COMPANY_NAME}} {Company industry} case study customer story"
6. "{{COMPANY_NAME}} {their tech stack} replaced migration customer"
```

**Lite mode (WebSearch):**
```
Same queries via WebSearch tool
```

**Goal:** Find at least 1 warm-up talking point from the last 30 days.
Find at least 1 proof point that specifically matches their industry or tech stack.

---

## STEP 3 — {{QUALIFICATION_FRAMEWORK}} Gap Analysis

Map current knowledge. Mark each element:
✅ Confirmed | ⬜ Unknown | 🎯 Probe in this meeting | 🚫 Negative signal

**Default: MEDDPICC**

| Letter | Question | Status | What We Know | Goal for This Meeting |
|--------|----------|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| M — Metrics | What numbers change if they fix this? | | | |
| E — Economic Buyer | Who approves budget? On the call? | | | |
| D — Decision Criteria | How will they evaluate options? | | | |
| D — Decision Process | What steps to get to yes? Timeline? | | | |
| P — Paper Process | Procurement/legal/security steps? | | | |
| I — Identified Pain | What specific pain in their words? | | | |
| C — Champion | Who advocates internally? | | | |
| C — Competition | What else are they evaluating? | | | |

**Goal for this meeting:** Fill at least 3 blank elements.
**Priority:** Confirm I (Identified Pain) first. Everything else depends on it.

---

## STEP 4 — 3 Whys Status

| Why | Status | Evidence |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Why Anything (cost of status quo) | ✅/⬜ | |
| Why {{PRODUCT_NAME}} (capability match) | ✅/⬜ | |
| Why Now (urgency driver) | ✅/⬜ | |

If any Why is ⬜ → it becomes a goal for this meeting.

---

## STEP 5 — Build the Meeting Brief

**Save as:** `accounts/{account}/meetings/{YYYY-MM-DD}-meeting-brief.md`

```markdown
# Meeting Brief — {Company} {Meeting Type}
**Date/Time:** {date and time}
**Duration:** {duration}
**Type:** Intro / Discovery / Follow-up / AE-led

## Attendees
| Name | Role | Our Side |
|------|------|----------|
| [Their name] | [Title] | {{SELLER_NAME}} / {{AE_NAME}} |

## Executive Summary
[1 paragraph: who they are, where we are in the cycle, top 1-2 signals, meeting goal]

## Hot Signals to Reference (open with one)
1. [Signal 1 — dated, confirmed from research]
2. [Signal 2]

## Meeting Goals
1. Confirm: [{{QUALIFICATION_FRAMEWORK}} element]
2. Confirm: [{{QUALIFICATION_FRAMEWORK}} element]
3. Establish: [Which Why needs to be built]
4. Close with: [Specific CTA]

## Recommended Agenda
| Time | Topic | Owner |
|------|-------|-------|
| 0:00 | Warm up — reference [hot signal] | {{SELLER_NAME}} |
| 0:03 | Purpose framing: "Here's why we asked for this time…" | {{AE_NAME}} |
| 0:08 | Discovery (see questions below) | {{AE_NAME}} |
| 0:25 | Value — 1-2 specific capabilities matched to their pain | {{AE_NAME}} |
| 0:35 | Proof point: [Customer story from live search] | {{AE_NAME}} |
| 0:40 | Objection handling | {{AE_NAME}} |
| 0:50 | Next step | {{AE_NAME}} |

## Discovery Questions ({{QUALIFICATION_FRAMEWORK}}-mapped)

### Pain (I — Identified Pain)
- "Walk me through what [their process] looks like today — step by step."
- "What breaks first when [their scale challenge] happens?"
- "What have you tried to solve this? What worked, what didn't?"

### Metrics (M)
- "If you fixed [pain], what would that mean in hours/dollars/time?"
- "How are you measuring success for [project]?"

### Economic Buyer (E)
- "When a decision like this comes up, who else gets involved?"
- "Who would ultimately sign off on something like this?"

### Decision Process (D) + Paper Process (P)
- "If this conversation goes well, what would next steps look like on your end?"
- "Is there a timeline you're working toward?"
- "What does procurement/legal look like for something like this?"

### Competition (C)
- "What else are you evaluating? What does your stack look like today?"

### Champion (C)
- "Who on your team would be most involved in evaluating this?"

## Expected Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're happy with [current system]" | "What would have to be true for you to consider alternatives?" |
| "No budget right now" | "Understood — is this a timing question or a priority question?" |
| "We're evaluating X" | "What's your evaluation criteria? We'd love to make sure {{PRODUCT_NAME}} is in the mix." |
| [Add objections from research/prior calls] | |

## Proof Points Ready

**Source priority:** Live search (company case studies page) → CRM proof points → references/proof-points.md

1. **[Customer]** — [metric from live search] — use when: [moment in conversation] — Source: [URL]
2. **[Customer]** — [metric] — use when: [moment] — Source: [URL]

## Sales Motion Route + CTA
**Route:** Classic / Sprint / Fast / Unknown
**Proposed CTA:**
- Classic → "Let's schedule a Technical Workshop with our solutions team."
- Sprint → "Let's lock in a Sprint Zero — 3 hours to scope this properly."
- Fast → "Let's schedule a kickoff — what's your timeline?"
- Unknown → "Would a 30-min follow-up to go deeper on [topic] make sense?"

## {{QUALIFICATION_FRAMEWORK}} Pre-Meeting Status
[Copy gap analysis table from Step 3]

## After the Call
→ Run `/call-debrief` immediately while context is hot.
